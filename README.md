## About Me✨

Hello! My name is Max, and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Software Developer currently studying at Code Institute. I've always been fascinated by both hardware and software, constantly driven by a curiosity to understand how things work. Growing up in the picturesque countryside of Devon, England, I've developed a keen interest in technology and its practical applications.

I see myself as a practical individual who thrives in team settings. Collaboration and teamwork are key components of my work ethic, and I believe that together, we can achieve great things. Besides my passion for technology, I enjoy staying active and going to the gym. It's a great way for me to stay focused and energized.

## My Goals🌱

My journey in the tech industry is just beginning, and I'm eager to learn and grow as a developer. I hope to work in the tech industry at a respected company someday, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and make a positive impact.

I'm always looking to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and professionals. If you're interested in chatting about technology, software development, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!
